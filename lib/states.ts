/**
 * Indian states and union territories.
 *
 * Codes, not names, in the database. A name typed twice is two different states
 * to a `GROUP BY` — "West Bengal" and "west bengal" would split a report in half
 * — and names get renamed while codes do not.
 *
 * These are the ISO 3166-2:IN subdivision codes without the `IN-` prefix, which
 * is what most Indian address and logistics systems already speak.
 *
 * Blank (`''`) is a real value everywhere this is used: a shop whose state
 * nobody has filled in, and an occasion kept across all of India.
